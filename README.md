Sign Language Recognition Using AI/ML

Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a Sign Language Recognition system using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. The goal is to translate hand gestures into corresponding sign language letters or words, enabling better communication for the hearing impaired. The system uses computer vision techniques to detect gestures and machine learning models to classify them.

Features
Real-time gesture recognition.
High accuracy with convolutional neural networks (CNN).
Preprocessing images using OpenCV.
Support for common sign language letters (ASL alphabet).
Scalable for future extensions (e.g., full words, sentences).
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Machine Learning Framework: TensorFlow, Keras
Computer Vision: OpenCV
Data Manipulation: Numpy, Pandas
Visualization: Matplotlib
Dataset: American Sign Language (ASL) hand gesture images

Installation Instructions
Step 1: Clone the repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/username/sign-language-recognition.git
cd sign-language-recognition

Step 2: Install dependencies
Install the required Python packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 3: Prepare the dataset
Download a public ASL alphabet dataset or use your own dataset.
Place the dataset in the data/ directory.

Step 4: Train the model
Run the training script to train the machine learning model:

bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
This script will process the data and train a CNN model to recognize sign language gestures.

Step 5: Real-time gesture recognition
To run real-time recognition, connect a webcam and run the following command:

bash
Copy code
python real_time_recognition.py

Dataset
The dataset used for training consists of images of various American Sign Language (ASL) letters. Each image represents a different hand gesture corresponding to a specific letter. You can either use a publicly available ASL dataset or create your own dataset using your webcam.

Model Architecture
The model is based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are particularly effective for image classification tasks. Key layers include:

Convolutional layers for feature extraction.
Pooling layers for reducing the spatial dimensions of the feature maps.
Fully connected layers for predicting the corresponding sign language letter.
Results
The model achieves high accuracy on the ASL dataset, with real-time gesture recognition enabled through webcam input. The results show promising performance in classifying individual letters.

Usage
Once trained, the system can be used to recognize hand gestures from a webcam feed in real-time. The predicted sign language letter will be displayed on the screen.

Future Enhancements
Support for recognizing full words and sentences in sign language.
Improved accuracy with more advanced deep learning models.
Integration with additional sign languages (e.g., BSL, ISL).
Enhanced gesture detection under varying lighting conditions.
